# Filing US Tax Returns from Sweden

Filing tax returns can be hard, especially if the IRS is involved, you're not an American citizen, and/or you are no longer in the US. 
Of course, when all three of these apply, it's also during a pandemic. Go figure.

This file is an imperfect and probably futile attempt to catalogue all the little details and gotchas that I will immediately repress once this year's returns are safely sent.

## Reminders

### During the tax year

- Save a copy of last year's tax returns.
- Put all related tax documents in one space:
  - bank statements
  - pay statements
- Keep a digital version of said documents.
- Make note of:
  - address changes
  - dates abroad
  - all bank accounts and funds and such, including branch contact information (address and phone number)

### Filing the tax return

- Start early, like, really really early
- Take a look at last year's return
  - What's changed?
- Possibly hire professionals ahead of time
  - Let them know about any exceptional circumstances (e.g. foreign investments)

## Mailing shit from Sweden to the US, DHL edition

- [Here](https://www.irs.gov/filing/submission-processing-center-street-addresses-for-private-delivery-service-pds) are the mailing addresses for various IRS offices if you use services like DHL
- For DHL: make a shipping label [here](https://expresseasy.se/) (and not any other DHL website, they have tons), one for each envelope/location
- You WILL need a phone number for each IRS office - let me know which office(s) you’re sending to and I’ll tell you (they’re ridiculously hard to find, but if you want to see for yourself check [here](https://www.irs.gov/irm/part21/irm_21-008-001r), under Section 21.8.1.2.3.1)
- The cost (399kr) includes a DHL envelope that easily fits regular A4 papers/envelopes inside, or you can use your own
- You get a 10-digit code for each label - get thee (and thine mail and code) to a [service point](https://locator.dhl.com/) (that’s where you can get a DHL envelope if you want)
- You MUST do the shipping label business at home on your laptop (it’s ridiculously hard on a phone) before you go to the service point

## Shit to go through later

- If you're a US citizen or resident alien (e.g. green card holder) living in a foreign country, your US tax returns should be mailed to:
  ```
  Department of the Treasury
  Internal Revenue Service Center
  Austin, TX 73301-0215
  USA
  ```
- However, IF you are enclosing a cheque or money order, mail the return to:
  ```
  Internal Revenue Service
  P.O. Box 1303
  Charlotte, NC 28201-1303 U.S.A.
  ```
- Approved private delivery services: DHL, FedEx, UPS
- If using [private delivery services](https://www.irs.gov/filing/private-delivery-services-pds), the [mailing address](https://www.irs.gov/filing/submission-processing-center-street-addresses-for-private-delivery-service-pds) is different!
  - Private delivery services cannot deliver items to IRS P.O. boxes - must use the USPS to mail any items to an IRS P.O. box address.
- DHL, at least, requires a phone number for the recipient.
- "Taxpayer service, formerly offered at the foreign posts of duty, is no longer available." [[source]](https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-my-local-office-internationally)
