# Healthcare in Sweden

NB: This is based solely on my personal experiences, and may not be the "proper" steps to go about getting care. Proceed with caution.

### Requirements
- A personnummer
- BankID (or a way to confirm identity)

## Dental Care

Dental care is not covered by private insurance plans - it is paid out of pocket. However, 
Sweden offers a national dental care subsidy of 300-600 SEK ([more info](https://www.folktandvardenstockholm.se/behandlingar-och-priser/priser/tandvardsstod/)) to registered residents.

Since the subsidy is **not** retroactive, if possible, wait until you are successfully registered with Försäkringskassan using [Form 5456](https://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatpers/tjanster/sok/!ut/p/z1/dYzBCsIwEES_pkezW1uleAsVKlFQ6aF1L9JKTIsxKWk04Ndb8CTo3N7wZoCgBjLNs1eN761p9MQnWp7TzTqPixy3WZEskB8PcZLu50KUCBUQ0KTgn3AEAaS0bT9v3LRJpoCcvEonHXu4qe68H8ZVhBGGEJiyVmnJLvYe4a9JZ0cP9bcJpTQw3MxrJ6vZGzFE1L8!/dz/d5/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80TmxFL1o2XzhQSDRISjAyTUcwUUYwQUo0T1I0NU5IR0Yy/#/?sokord=5456) before seeking treatment.

- Choose a tandvården and register with them
- Make an appointment using BankID
- Pay for treatment[*]

[*] Some dental clinics offer a contract where you pay a [monthly fee](https://www.folktandvardenstockholm.se/behandlingar-och-priser/frisktandvard/) for general dental care, instead of paying per treatment. Depending on your teeth, this might work out to be cheaper in the long run, especially since dental care is not cheap in Sweden (see prices [here](https://www.folktandvardenstockholm.se/behandlingar-och-priser/priser/prislista/)).
