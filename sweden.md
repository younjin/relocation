# Moving to Sweden

<!--
## Pre-Arrival
-->

Visit this [checklist creator](https://www.movetogothenburg.com/personal-guide/#questions) for a custom checklist.

### Documents
- [ ] Check that current passport is valid for >2 years
  - Renew passport before starting the process otherwise
<!-- something about multiple passports -->

<!--
  - Marriage or domestic partnership certificate
  - Birth certificate for each child
-->

- [ ] Collect other relevant documents (possibly optional / if applicable):
  - Medical and dental files
  - Academic transcripts
  - Financial and pension documents
  - References from former employees and/or landlords
  - Proof (e.g. a letter) to show that benefits at the origin have ended

<!-- life and accident insurance -->

### Prior to Moving
- [ ] Talk with accountants about the move/new financial situation
- [ ] Start learning Swedish - some resources:
  - [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) (available on web and mobile)
  - [Swedish for Immigrants](https://vuxenutbildning.stockholm/sfi/swedish-for-immigrants/)
  - [Learning Swedish](https://learningswedish.se/courses/)
  - [Swedish Online](http://www.folkuniversitetet.se/In-English/Swedish-courses/Swedish-On-Line/)

### Residence and Work Permit
- [ ] Find a job in Sweden

- [ ] If bringing belongings look into international shipping/air freight

- [ ] Apply for and acquire a residence and work permit from **Migrationsverket**
  - The employer should help with this process

### Mailing Address and Phone Number
- [ ] Find a place to live
- [ ] Acquire a phone number

Note: All steps after this process require a mailing address in Sweden (a phone number is beneficial but not strictly necessary).

### Biometrics
- [ ] Book an appointment to submit biometrics at **Migrationsverket**
  - Appointments may not be available for several weeks, so book as early as possible
  - Citizens of some countries do this in their origin country
    - Canadians can book the appointment after arriving in Sweden
- [ ] Submit biometrics at **Migrationsverket**

- [ ] Receive the [residence permit card](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Residence-permit-card.html) from **Migrationsverket** [1-2 weeks from appointment]

### Customs
- [ ] Fill out Swedish Customs forms from **Tullverket** for duty relief (if applicable)

### Personnummer
- [ ] Fill out the form from **Skatteverket** to register in the Population Register (folkbokföring)
- [ ] Submit the form (and show supporting documentation) to **Skatteverket**
  - No appointment needed, but do this as soon as possible after receiving the residence permit card
- [ ] Receive personnummer from **Skatteverket** [variable time; 4-12 weeks is common]

Note: A personnummer is required to receive healthcare as a resident.

### Bank Account
- [ ] If possible, open a bank account without a personnummer
  - Certain branches of Handelsbanken, Nordea, and SEB allow this - not sure about other banks
  - Only certain banks have online banking/BankID/etc. - check for benefits of interest
  - Check with employer to see if there are any agreements

Note: Having a Swedish bank account is crucial - Swedish employers only pay salary to Swedish bank accounts (citation needed). It's impossible to get by on cash alone, as Sweden is almost entirely cashless.

### Social Insurance
- [ ] Once registered with Skatteverket (i.e. have a personnummer), mail in [Form 5456](https://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatpers/flytta-till-arbeta-studera-eller-nyanland-i-sverige/flytta-till_sverige/) to [**Försäkringskassan**](www.forsakringskassan.se) (with supporting documentation) to apply for:
  - a [European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)](https://www.forsakringskassan.se/privatpers/resa_arbeta_studera_eller_fa_vard_utomlands/resa_utomlands/) - optional
  - a benefit, allowance, or compensation
  - NB: If it can wait, hold off on receiving dental care until registered with Försäkringskassan to receive the annual dental benefit (renews in July, not January)

### Residence ID Card
- [ ] Book an appointment at **Skatteverket** to apply for a residence ID card
- [ ] Pick up the residence ID card in person [1-2 weeks from appointment]

Note: The residence ID card is not strictly necessary, but may be required to acquire BankID.

### BankID/Swish
- [ ] Make an appointment with the bank to acquire BankID and set up Swish
- [ ] Depending on the bank, also set up online banking (i.e. on the web, outside of a mobile app)

### Digital Mailbox
- [ ] Set up a digital mailbox (e.g. Kivra) to receive important mail digitally
