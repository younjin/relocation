## Frequently Asked Questions

As someone who was previously based out of the New York office, I am often asked several questions, usually in quick succession:

- Why did you move to Sweden?
- Did you move for work?
- Did you move for love?
- Isn't it super dark and cold there?
- What about your salary???
- What do you like about Sweden?
- Do you hate the US or something?

This jist is an attempt to organise my thoughts on these (and other) questions, and also so that if I ever feel lazy, I can give them a convenient link where they can hopefully satisfy their curiosity.

### Why did you move to Sweden?

Oh boy. I have a ton of half-formed answers to this question, and it's been difficult to answer this in a succinct way. 
I will answer the other questions first, and possibly revisit my non-answer here - I think that the answers to those together form a more complete picture of why I left.

I believe that it's sometimes important to distinguish whether one moves _away_ from a place, versus moving _toward_ a new place. I'd like to think that I did a little bit of both here.

### Did you move for work?

Mostly. I was offered a great opportunity, where I would be able to work with a great manager that I have a lot of respect for.
