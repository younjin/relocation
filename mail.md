# Mail in Sweden

[PostNord](https://www.postnord.se/en) is the Swedish postal service. 
Instead of post offices, they have [service points](https://www.postnord.se/en/our-tools/find-service-point), where you can send and receive mail, and purchase mail-related material (e.g. stamps, envelopes, boxes). 
They are usually located within a larger shop (e.g. grocery stores, gas stations).

## Sending mail

### [Sending letters](https://www.postnord.se/en/sending/letters-and-postcards/letter)

- Stamps can be bought in person, or [online](https://shop.postnord.se/ebutik/).
- PostNord also offers a [postcard service](https://www.postnord.se/en/sending/letters-and-postcards/postcards) - you create the postcard digitally, and they send it for you (anywhere in the world).
- One stamp has a value of 12 SEK - this is sufficient to send a letter anywhere in Sweden.

#### International letters

- To send mail internationally, put two stamps - this is good for anywhere in the world.
- Letters can be up to 2kg and can be sent from yellow mailboxes or service points.
- Write "Prioritaire" on the envelope before sending.


### Sending parcels

#### International parcels

- Send these from a service point.
- Parcels can be up to 20kg.

## Receiving mail

- Your name **must** be labelled with your name to receve mail. (Your full name isn't necessary - the common format seems to be "J. Doe" for "Jane Doe".)
- Provide the sender with your email and phone number - PostNord will use them to reach you if there are any problems.

- Letters, postcards, and small parcels will be delivered directly to your mailbox.
- For any mail that PostNord won't deliver directly to you, you will receive an `avi`, a notification letting you know where you can pick up your mail.

- If you live in a house, then you need to get your own mailbox. See instructions [here](https://www.postnord.se/en/receiving/mail-delivery/mailboxes-at-freestanding-homes-and-townhouses).
- If you live in an apartment, it is not necessary to put your apartment number when giving out your address (see below).

## Tracking mail

### Website

- You can track mail by the shipment ID [here](https://www.postnord.se/en/our-tools/track-and-trace).

### App

- PostNord has an [app to track incoming and outgoing parcels](https://www.postnord.se/en/our-tools/postnord-app).
- The app will tell you how big the parcel is, how much it weighs, and its general status (e.g. on its way, ready to pick up).
- When receiving parcels that require identification, you can sometimes use BankID in the app beforehand - you then won't have to show ID when picking up the parcel. 
This is useful in some cases, such as if you need someone else to pick it up.
- Some returns for purchases are also managed through the app.

## Changing addresses

- You generally cannot receive parcels to an address if you do not live there. (Talk to your employer if you need to receive mail at your workplace.)
- If you receive mail for a previous resident, draw a line across the name of the person and write "avflyttad" on the envelope. Put the letter in a yellow mailbox.

## Unwanted mail

- To avoid junk/spam mail, put a sign on your mailbox with the phrase `Ingen reklam, tack!` ("No advertisements, please!")
- For free newspapers, put a sign on your mailbox with the phrase `Inga gratistidningar, tack!` ("No free newspapers, please!")
- To combine the two, use `Ingen reklam eller gratistidningar, tack!` (No advertisements or free newspapers, please!")

- See [this site](https://www.hallakonsument.se/konsumentratt/sa-slipper-du-fa-oonskad-reklam/) for how to avoid:
  - Advertising addressed to you
  - General advertising
  - Advertising by phone
